      <description>Are you familiar or experienced with LaTeX? In preparation for the next revision, the VHDL Analysis and Standarisation Group (VASG) decided to migrate the sources of the IEEE Std 1076-2019 Language Reference Manual (LRM) from a closed source binary file based tool (Adobe FrameMaker) to an open source text based solution (LaTeX); together with using a forge (gitlab.com/IEEE-P1076) for coordinating and keeping track of the modifications.
Although many people think that the standards community is driven by vendors, that is a mistake noawadays.</description>
