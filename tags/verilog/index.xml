      <title>Mixed HDL on Fomu, with GHDL and Yosys</title>

      <description>Section Mixed HDL on Fomu of the FPGA Tomu Workshop contains Makefile based examples for synthesising mixed language (VHDL and Verilog) designs using open source tooling. Find sources at im-tomu/fomu-workshop: mixed-hdl/blink.
NOTE: The workshop uses im-tomu/fomu-toolchain, which is based on open-tool-forge/fpga-toolchain. Hence, makefiles expect ghdl-yosys-plugin to be built into Yosys. Other packaging solutions can be used too, but using ghdl-yosys-plugin as a module requires adding -m ghdl to the yosys call in the Makefile.</description>

      <title>How to convert vhdl to other formats</title>

      <description>I made a list of &amp;ldquo;How to convert vhdl to &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; in hopes it gets indexed by the search engines. All commands are similar, they are listed so common search phrases get indexed.
The format translation can be done with the yosys&amp;rsquo;s write_*commands. Therefore, in order to them to work, ghdl, yosys and ghdl-yosys-plugin have to be installed (make sure they are updated).
In the following examples, ghdl is being used, in what I believe, is the most straightforward way.</description>
