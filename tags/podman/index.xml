      <description>hdl/containers: README.md
This repository contains scripts and GitHub Actions (GHA) YAML workflows for building, testing and deploying OCI images (aka Docker images) including open source EDA tooling. All of them are pushed to hub.docker.com/u/hdlc. See hdl.github.io/containers for further details and contributing guidelines.
  ghdl/docker: DEPRECATED.md
Some images related to synthesis and PnR were moved to hdl/containers and hub.docker.com/u/hdlc. Some of those are now mirrored to ghdl/synth:* for backwards compatibility, but are no longer built in this repository.</description>
