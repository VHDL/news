      <description>This repository contains references to package recipes (PKGBUILD files) for electronic design automation (EDA) tools/projects to be built as MinGW-w64 targets on MSYS2 (MINGW32 and MINGW64). The main purpose is coordination of contributions for upstreaming all tools/projects to official MSYS2 repositories, and having them updated periodically. The default package manager (pacman) allows installing multiple tools at once through group mingw-w64-*-eda (i686|x86_64) . Find further details, along with usage and contribution guidelines at hdl.</description>

      <title>How to convert vhdl to other formats</title>

      <description>I made a list of &amp;ldquo;How to convert vhdl to &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; in hopes it gets indexed by the search engines. All commands are similar, they are listed so common search phrases get indexed.
The format translation can be done with the yosys&amp;rsquo;s write_*commands. Therefore, in order to them to work, ghdl, yosys and ghdl-yosys-plugin have to be installed (make sure they are updated).
In the following examples, ghdl is being used, in what I believe, is the most straightforward way.</description>
