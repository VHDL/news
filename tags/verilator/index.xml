      <title>Open Source Verification Bundle (OSVB)</title>

      <description>OSVB gathers the most popular open source verification Frameworks and Methodologies for VHDL and System Verilog: cocotb, OSVVM, SVUnit, UVVM, VUnit. Each of them was created and is maintained by different groups of people, in different contexts and with different backgrounds. All evolved into standalonish solutions involving build and test execution helpers, along with verification components for standard interfaces. However, each project prioritised certain features, while others didnâ€™t receive so much care.</description>

      <description>This repository contains references to package recipes (PKGBUILD files) for electronic design automation (EDA) tools/projects to be built as MinGW-w64 targets on MSYS2 (MINGW32 and MINGW64). The main purpose is coordination of contributions for upstreaming all tools/projects to official MSYS2 repositories, and having them updated periodically. The default package manager (pacman) allows installing multiple tools at once through group mingw-w64-*-eda (i686|x86_64) . Find further details, along with usage and contribution guidelines at hdl.</description>
