      <description>OSVB gathers the most popular open source verification Frameworks and Methodologies for VHDL and System Verilog: cocotb, OSVVM, SVUnit, UVVM, VUnit. Each of them was created and is maintained by different groups of people, in different contexts and with different backgrounds. All evolved into standalonish solutions involving build and test execution helpers, along with verification components for standard interfaces. However, each project prioritised certain features, while others didnâ€™t receive so much care.</description>
